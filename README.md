# AT-GRU
Predictive deep learning model for subsurface ocean chlorophyll concentration.
This code is from the paper ''Sparse2Dense Reconstructing Chlorophyll Profiles with Deep Neural Network to Predict Global SCM''.
The entire code consists of three parts. "model.py" describes the network structure, "preprocess.py" includes the preprocessing and partitioning of data, and "train.py" describes the entire training process.
